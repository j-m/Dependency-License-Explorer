# Attempt at a licence viewer,

## What we have:

    + HTML & CSS formatted to view the nested dependency structure.
    + A script to export locally cloned maven output as JSON, *dir_objectify.js*
    + JavaScript to parse the third-part dependencies text file into JSON.

## To-dos:

    - Integrate so HTML/CSS is automatically generated from local txt files(_maven output_)
    - Ability to use aliases/synonyms, blacklist and whitelisting different licenses
