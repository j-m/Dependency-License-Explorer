# Dependency License Explorer
Given dependency information this Open Source software generates a tree-based view of the dependicies of a project. 
Per dependency it requires: license information, name, and GAV. It also requires a tree-structure of the dependencies. *(Refer to the example projects for more details.)* The files in the examples were generated by the IDE; so you do not have to create them yourself. It is fairly easy to match this style, so if you use something other than Maven just convert manually it to this format. **Support for other project types is planned.** 

Generated display is HTML/CSS only; any **modern** browser will support this - we recommend **Google Chrome**. To edit/view more detailed dependency information, as well as generating displays in the first place, requires only vanilla JavaScript. 

**No 3rd party assets** have been, or will be, used.
